0. Have a basis for benchmarks AND tests before optimizing ( and only do it if you need to )
1. plan for optimizing the positive, least complex path first and foremost
2. let the netagive path fail fast, ALWAYS
3. Do NOT try to express low level compiler concerns such as inlineing
4. Reduce conditional branches/struct size in functions, most can be preempted as a state
5. Keep functions super simple, if you need to do something complex, you are probably doing it wrong somewhere else
